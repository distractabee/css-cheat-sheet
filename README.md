# css-cheat-sheet

## Description

This project collects some useful basic and more advanced snippets of CSS in a snappy visual presentation.

I built this project because I wanted to have a central location to access some of my most frequently used bits of CSS as well as some more complicated sections of code that add extra visual flair to my projects. This saves me (and anyone else who may use it) from having to frequently retype identical blocks of code.


## Usage

Using the website is very striaghtforward but it does have some fun features. Selecting a chunk of text to copy gives you a high contrast highlight to make it easy to see what you've selected. Also, hovering over an box will cause the borders to glow. Fun! 

It is also designed to be responsive to tablet and phone screen widths.

## Credits

This project was completed using some code that was started by my instructor John Lynch in my programming bootcamp seminar. It also includes some code that was created by the bootcamp (specifically the glow on hover code and the linear gradient background).
